Movie Recommendation System using Content-Based Filtering
This project implements a movie recommendation system using content-based filtering techniques. Content-based filtering recommends items based on their attributes or features, such as the genres, keywords, cast, director, and tagline of movies in this case.

Dataset
The dataset (movies.csv) used in this project contains information about movies, including their titles, genres, keywords, taglines, cast, and directors.

Workflow
Data Loading and Preprocessing:

The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame (movie_data).
Missing values in selected features (genres, keywords, tagline, cast, director) are replaced with empty strings.
Feature Extraction:

Relevant features (genres, keywords, tagline, cast, director) are combined into a single string (combined_features).
The combined text data is converted into numerical feature vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization.
Similarity Calculation:

Cosine similarity is computed between the feature vectors of movies to determine how similar they are based on their content features.
A similarity matrix (similarity_scores) is generated where each element represents the similarity score between two movies.
Recommendation Generation:

The user inputs the name of their favorite movie (user_movie_name).
Using fuzzy matching (difflib.get_close_matches), the closest match for the user-provided movie name is identified from the dataset.
Based on the identified movie, a list of similar movies is generated by sorting movies in descending order of their similarity scores.
The top recommended movies are displayed to the user.
User Interaction:

After displaying recommended movies based on the user's first input, the system prompts the user to input another favorite movie (user_movie_name).
The process of finding the closest match and generating recommendations is repeated for the new input.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Scikit-learn (sklearn)
Usage
Ensure Python and necessary libraries (pandas, scikit-learn) are installed.
Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
Place your dataset (movies.csv) in the project directory.
Run the script movie_recommendation.py to load the dataset, train the recommendation model, and interactively provide movie recommendations based on user input.
Example
Upon running the script, you can input your favorite movie and receive a list of recommended movies based on their similarity to your input. The process can be repeated multiple times to explore recommendations for different movies.
